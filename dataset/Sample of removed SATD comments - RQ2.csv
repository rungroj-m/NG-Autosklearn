  * Changes from commons.modeler:
  * 
  * - use DynamicMBean
  * - remove methods not used in tomcat and redundant/not very generic
  * - must be created from the ManagedBean - I don't think there were any direct
  * uses, but now it is required.
  * - some of the gratuituous flexibility removed - instead this is more predictive and
  * strict with the use cases.
  * - all Method and metadata is stored in ManagedBean. BaseModelBMean and ManagedBean act
  * like Object and Class. 
  * - setModelMBean is no longer called on resources ( not used in tomcat )
  * - no caching of Methods for now - operations and setters are not called repeatedly in most 
  * management use cases. Getters should't be called very frequently either - and even if they
  * are, the overhead of getting the method should be small compared with other JMX costs ( RMI, etc ).

  * Any state can transition to FAILED.
  *
  * Calling start() while a component is in states STARTING_PREP, STARTING or
  * STARTED has no effect.
  *
  * Calling start() while a component is in state NEW will cause init() to be
  * called immediately after the start() method is entered.
  *
  * Calling stop() while a component is in states STOPPING_PREP, STOPPING or
  * STOPPED has no effect.
  *
  * Calling stop() while a component is in state NEW transitions the component
  * to STOPPED. This is typically encountered when a component fails to start and
  * does not start all its sub-components. When the component is stopped, it will
  * try to stop all sub-components - even those it didn't start.
  *
  * MUST_STOP is used to indicate that the {@link #stop()} should be called on
  * the component as soon as {@link #start()} exits. It is typically used when a
  * component has failed to start.
  *
  * MUST_DESTROY is used to indicate that the {@link #destroy()} should be called on
  * the component as soon as {@link #stop()} exits. It is typically used when a
  * component is not designed to be restarted.
  *
  * Attempting any other transition will throw {@link LifecycleException}.
  *
  * </pre>
  * The {@link LifecycleEvent}s fired during state changes are defined in the
  * methods that trigger the changed. No {@link LifecycleEvent}s are fired if the
  * attempted transition is not valid.
  *
  * TODO: Not all components may transition from STOPPED to STARTING_PREP. These
  * components should use MUST_DESTROY to signal this.
