1991, these be pathological case but retain in case somebody subclasse pron ,0
1992, this be a rather hairy case one of pron subclass know that pron need to update the archive but at the same time there be no resource know to pron that would need to be add only the subclass seem to know what be go on this happen if jar detect that the manifest have change for example the manifest be not part of any resource because of pron support for inline manifest s if pron invoke createemptyzip like ant 1 5 2 do pron will loose all stuff that have be in the original archive bugzilla report 17780 ,1

2072, attribute name and value while the xml spec do not require preserve the order afaik some ant test do rely on the exact order the follow code be copy from attributeimpl pron could also just use sax2 attributes and convert to sax1 dom attribute node can also be store in sax2 attribute xxx under jdk 1 4 pron can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick the only exception to this order be the treatment of refid a number of datatype check if refid be set when other attribute be set this check will not work if the build script have the other attribute before the refid attribute so now ant 1 7 the refid attribute will be process first ,0

2208, todo use or remove,0
2209, pron guess this can happen as a result of a bad file read in this case pron would be well to replace the incorrect value with anything valid e g the default value for the property but for the time be pron just prefer to be aware of any problem occur here most likely programming error so pron will bail out ms note can not bail out newly create element have blank value and must get the default also when load previous version of jmeter test script some value may not be right and should get default value ms todo review this and possibly change to,0

2242, todo cpercent be the same as cmedian here why and why pass pron to distributionline,0
2243, todo should the method signature of this method be change to match the super implementation use a testelement parameter instead of abstractlistenerelement this would require an instanceof check before add the listener below but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for sub class the java rule deal with this situation be not always intuitive and a subclass may think pron be call this version of the method when pron be really call the superclass version instead ,0
2244, todo should this method be synchronize all other function execute be,0
2245, todo should the engine be static,0

2820, delete a model element implement cascading delete to make sure model be still valid after element have be delete p the actual deletion be delegate to delete method in the rest of the factory for example a method deleteclass exist on corehelper delete method as deleteclass should only do those extra action that be necessary for the deletion of the modelelement pron i e deleteclass should only take care of thing specific to umlclass p the delete method in the uml factories should not be call directly throughout the code call should always refer to this method and never call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly the reason that pron be possible to call the deletexxx method directly be a pure implementation detail p the implementation of this method use a quite complicated if then else tree this be do to provide optimal performance and full compliance to the uml 1 4 metamodel the last remark refer to the fact that the uml 1 4 model use multiple inheritance in several place this have to be take into account p todo the requirement of the metamodel could probably be well determine by reflection on the metamodel then each association that a delete element participate in could be review to make sure that pron meet the requirement and if not be delete tfm p extensions and pron child be not take into account here pron do not require extra cleanup action not in the form of a call to the remove method as be normal for all child of mbase and not in the form of other behaviour pron want to implement via this operation param elem the element to be delete see org argouml model umlfactory delete java lang object,0
2821, do not allow connection to be create from a read only model element to any other todo this should be consider a workaround pron only work because by default pron place newly create relationship in the namespace of the fromelement the correct behavior in the presence of read only element really depend on the type of connection as well as the writeability of both end ,0

2831, update a compartment box call from updatelayout if there be a model event effect the attribute operation and from renderingchange in all case todo the above statement mean that the entire content of the compartment be be rebuild whenever an add remove of an attribute operation or a reception be detect pron would be well to have compartment listen for add and remove event and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild remark mvw this be a bit exaggerated since the populate method be already heavily optimize ,0

3818, no need to take a snapshot this be a performance optimization but not really important except for entity with huge mutable property value,0
3819, todo this be break for subquerie in statement other than select ,0
3820, the follow type be not support in rdms jdbc and therefore comment out however in some case map pron to character column work for many application but do not work for all case ,0
3821, todo should this be an error,0
3822, three general case pron check here as to whether to render a physical sql join 1 be pron parent a dotnode as well if so pron property reference be be further de reference 2 be this a dml statement 3 pron be ask to generate any need join generatejoin true or pron be currently process a select or from clause an additional check be the regression style join suppression check solely intend for the test suite the regression style join suppression be an additional check intend solely for use within the test suite this force the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser the underlying issue be that classic translator be simply wrong about pron decision on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of case the piece pron generally tend to miss be that inner join effect the result by further restrict the datum set a particular manifestation of this be the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit join if the query be shallow the result be that query list and query iterate could return different number of result,0
3823, todo figure out how this should be set this be the reason for failure regard index op and subclass join on theta join dialect not sure what behaviour pron be try to emulate joinsequence joinsequence getfrompart emulate the old addfromonly behavior ,0
3824, the preference here would be sqlfunctiontemplate hibernate timestamp current timestamp 1 false but this appear not to work jay nance 2006 09 22,0
3825, todo inexact what pron really need to know be be any outer join use,0
3826, todo not sure which either be correct could not find doc on how to do this do find various blog and forum mention that select current timestamp do not work ,0
3827, todo can not use generatesuffixe pron handle the initial suffix differently ,0
3828, do not need this because pron should never ever be select no column in an insert select and because pron cause a bug on db2,0
3829, start with an alias old style semi bad thing about this can not re alias another alias ,0
3830, todo bug this currently fail for name query for non pojo entity,0
3831, fixme pron do not have the associate entity table name here have to be do in a second pass,0
3832, this call be side effecty,0
3833, rdms do not directly support the trim function pron use rtrim and ltrim,0
3834, note at least pron local sql server 2005 express show this not work ,0
3835, note at least pron local mysql 5 1 install show this not work ,0
3836, use count as the default this mimic the old behavior although none may be a well option move forward in the case of callable,0
3837, perhaps not really necessary ,0
3838, todo what else to do here,0
3839, todo disable batch loading if lockmode read,0
3840, todo to handle concurrent write correctly the client should pass in a lock,0
3841, turn hibernate c3p0 into c3p0 so c3p0 get a chance to see all hibernate c3p0 ,0
3842, note there be a wierd implementation in the client side,0
3843, todo this be add to support initialize an entity s entityentry snapshot during reattach this should be refactore to instead expose a method to assemble a entityentry base on this state for return ,0
3844, do pron need to drop constraint before drop table in this dialect,0
3845, fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary param prop the configuration property,0
3846, do this dialect support check constraint,0
3847, this be call by sessionfactory irregardless pron just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call start,0
3848, do this dialect support the unique column syntax,0
3849, this be do here because pron may only know the type here ugly todo improve this a lot,0
3850, do this dialect support the for update syntax,0
3851, todo what be the implication of this,0
3852, todo yuck,0
3853, todo again how should this work for non pojo entity,0
3854, do this dialect support for update of allow particular row to be lock,0
3855, todo really bad evil hack to fix,0
3856, aliasrefnode resolve false false aliasrefnode gettext todo be pron kosher to do pron here todo be pron kosher to do pron here,0
3857, todo well to degrade to lazy false if uninstrumente,0
3858, do this dialect support the oracle style for update nowait syntax,0
3859, icky workaround for mysql bug,0
3860, pron have to set up the table later yuck,0
3861, todo somehow add the newly create foreign key to the internal collection,0
3862, this inner class implement a case statement perhaps pron be be a bit over clever here,0
3863, todo merge into one method,0
3864, todo this be a bit of copy paste from indexedcollection createprimarykey,0
3865, todo what type,0
3866, todo inefficient,0
3867, fixme get the persistentclass,0
3868, todo pron can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be make private ,0
3869, todo this be too conservative if all precede join be also inner join pron could use an inner join here,0
3870, todo redesign how propertyaccessors be acquire ,0
3871, todo not so sure this be need ,0
3872, create an index on the key column,0
3873, todo joinkeycolumnname foreignkeycolumnname should be call either here or at a slightly hig level in the stack to get all the information pron need right now hbmbinder do not support the,0
3874, todo improve this hack,0
3875, todo bad implementation cos pron depend upon ordering of mapping doc fix this require that collection persistentclass gain access to the mappings reference from configuration or the filterdefinition map directly sometime during configuration buildsessionfactory after all the type filter def be know and before build persister ,0
3876, use of trim here be ugly,0
3877, todo ideally pron need the construction of propertyaccessor to take the follow 1 entitymode 2 entitymode specific datum i e the classname for pojo entity 3 property specific datum base on the entitymode i e property name or dom4j node name the easy way with the introduction of the new runtime metamodel class would be the the follow predicate 1 propertyaccessorfactory getpropertyaccessor take reference to both a org hibernate metadata entitymodemetadata and org hibernate metadata property 2 what be now term a propertyaccessor store any value need from those two piece of information 3 code can then simply call propertyaccess getgetter with no parameter likewise with propertyaccessor getsetter,0
3878, can happen because of the multiple way cache remove can be invoke,0
3879, ick,0
3880, todo this be very suboptimal for some subclass namely component since pron do not take advantage of two phase load,0
3881, todo should this be session instantiate persister ,0
3882, todo suck this into initlaziness,0
3883, hibernate temp use jdbc metadata default be a temporary magic value the need for pron be intend to be alleviate with future developement thus pron be not define as an environment constant pron be use to control whether pron should consult the jdbc metadata to determine certain setting default value pron be useful to not do this when the database may not be available mainly in tool usage ,0
3884, todo be this right,0
3885, ie the subquery yuck,0
3886, use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug,0
3887, todo copy paste from recreate,0
3888, workaround for backward compatibility of set with no not null column assume all column be use in the row locator sql,0
3889, todo this eventually need to be remove,0
3890, todo remove,0
3891, just to help out during the load ugly i know,0
3892, hack workaround as sqlquery impl depend on have a key ,0
3893, todo handle the case of a foreign key to something other than the pk,0
3894, todo assume all collection disassemble to an array,0
3895, todo would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity subclass would emit a notification which the extendsqueue entry could react to ,0
3896, todo be pron really neceassry to provide configuration to collectionpersisters should pron not be enough with associated class or why do entitypersister be not get access to configuration the only reason pron could see that configuration get pass to collection persister be so that pron can look up the dom4j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name be apply at the collection element level be pron kid pron trivial to fix then just store and expose the node name on the entity persister which the collection persister look up anyway via other mean ,0
3897, todo deprecate remove eventually,0
3898, todo possibly relax that,0
3899, todo this be a bit dodgy come up with a well way to check this plus see above comment,0
3900, use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility,0
3901, todo this be temporary in that the end result will probably not take a property reference per se ,0
3902, todo well to handle dynamic filter through implicit dynamicfilterparameterspecification see the discussion there in dynamicfilterparameterspecification s javadocs as to why pron be currently not do that way ,0
3903, get the right object from the list would pron be easy to just call getentity,0
3904, todo should record how many property pron have reffere to and if pron do not get em all pron throw an exception way well than trial and error,0
3905, todo this dependency be kinda bad,0
3906, todo get sql render out of this package,0
3907, why do this matter,0
3908, important to account for newly save entity in query todo some kind of check for new status ,0
3909, todo can pron always use the null property approach for everything,0
3910, do this need holdlock also return tablename with updlock rowlock holdlock,0
3911, for set pron should end the collection load after resolve the entity since pron may call hashcode on the element todo or pron could do this polymorphically and have two different operation implement differently for array,0
3912, todo remove this and just have subclass use isolater isolatedwork directly ,0
3913, sql server at least need this drop after use strange,0
3914, be pron necessary to register exact since pron can only appear in a where clause,0
3915, for array pron should end the collection load before resolve the entity since the actual array instance be not instantiate during load todo or pron could do this polymorphically and have two different operation implement differently for array,0
3916, do this dialect support the alter table syntax,0
3917, this next bit be to allow for both unsaved value negative and for old behavior where version number do not get seed if pron be already set in the object todo shift pron into unsaved value strategy,0
3918, todo reenable if pron also fix the above todo,0
3919, orphan should not be delete during copy,0
3920, orphan should not be delete during merge,0
3921, todo suck this logic into the collection,0
3922, todo pron can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry s,0
3923, todo this bit actually have to be call after all cascade but since identity insert be call synchronously instead of asynchronously as other action pron be not,0
3924, this class have no proxy so do a shortcut,0
3925, todo should this be an initializeentityeventlistener watch out for performance,0
3926, todo nee map the prob be a proper key right,0
3927, todo well to pass the pron d in as an argument,0
3928, do pron even really need this the update will fail anyway ,0
3929, todo would pron be well to do a refresh from db,0
3930, this form use from annotation essentially the same as the above use a resultset mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment fixme annotation do not use pron so pron can be remove from pron pov deprecated param query the sql query string param resultsetref the result set mapping name param queryspace any specified query space use for auto flushing param cacheable whether the query result be cacheable param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the result param timeout a jdbc level timeout to be apply param fetchsize a jdbc level fetch size to be apply param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query param parametertype parameter type map param callable do the query string represent a callable object i e proc,0
3931, todo ugly here,0
3932, todo not quite sure about the full implication of this,0
3933, this only work because collection entry be keep in a sequence map by persistence context maybe pron should do like entity and keep a separate sequence set todo call entryset on an identitymap be slow,0
3934, todo pron d much rather have this do from endloadingcollection collectionpersister loadingcollectionentry ,0
3935, todo hack note here pron cleanup the load context when pron have no more local lce entry this work for the time be because really only the collection load context be implement long term this cleanup should become part of the close result set processing from the sandbox jdbc jdbc container code ,0
3936, todo add the notion of enable filter to the cachekey to differentiate filtered collection from non filter but cachekey be currently use for both collection and entity would ideally need to define two seperate one currently this work in conjuction with the check on defaultinitializecollectioneventhandler initializecollectionfromcache which make sure to not read from cache with enable filter early exit,0
3937, postload be need for ejb3 todo reuse the postloadevent ,0
3938, todo should pron check the current isolation mode explicitly,0
3939, brand new collection todo or an array pron can not lock object with array now,0
3940, todo iteratively get transient entity and retry merge until one of the follow condition 1 transientcopycache size 0 2 transientcopycache size be not decrease and copycache size be not increase todo find out if retry can add entity to copycache do not think pron can for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there be still any transient entity,0
3941, null or brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle array which have no snapshot so pron can not do any well,0
3942, todo perhaps pron should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the define unsaved value,0
3943, provide query splitting method which be originally in querytranslator br todo this will need to be refactore at some point author josh,0
3944, todo most of below be take verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic or super type pron,0
3945, todo currently expect that the individual with expression apply to the same sql table join this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property value may be come from different table in the joined hierarchy at some point pron should expand this to support that capability however that have some difficulty 1 the big be how to handle or when the individual comparison be link to different sql join 2 here pron would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which pron apply and then pass that information back to the fromelement so pron can pass pron along to the joinsequence,0
3946, no explicit select expression render the pron d and property projection list for every persister in the from clause into a single token node todo the only reason pron need this stuff now be collection filter pron should get rid of derive select clause completely,0
3947, todo well way,0
3948, hack alert attempt to work around ghost impliedfromelement that occasionally show up between the actual thing be join this consistently occur from index node at least against many to many not sure if there be other condition essentially look ahead to the next fromelement that actually write something to the sql,0
3949, not possible to simply re use the versionpropertynode here as pron cause oom error due to circularity,0
3950, this function have a template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast to avoid use an interface yuck ,0
3951, at some point the generate phase need to be move out of here because a single object level dml may spawn multiple sql dml command execution possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency sake probably well to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegate queryloader statementexecutor pron also not sure why queryloader currently even have a dependency on this at all do pron need pron ideally like to see the walker pron give to the delegate directly ,0
3952, todo this be only need during compilation can pron eliminate the instvar,0
3953, todo absolutely no usage of this constructor form can pron go away,0
3954, todo be this a bit ugly,0
3955, even here if only property map to the base table be reference in the set and where clause this could be handle by the basicdelegate todo decide if pron be well performance wise to perform that check or to simply use the multitableupdatedelegate,0
3956, todo remove these last two as batcher be no long manage connection,0
3957, very important this class need to be free of any static reference to any cglib or javassist class otherwise user will always need both on pron classpath no matter which if either pron use another option here would be to remove the hibernate ispropertyinitialize method and have the user go through the sessionfactory to get this information ,0
3958, todo pron really need to be able to deal with component path here also this be difficult because the hql sql grammar expect all those node type to be fromreferencenode one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclause fromelement combo as a child of the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement that be probably the easy approach read least amount of change to the grammar and code but just do not feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from clause,0
3959, todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade delete and not gen those delete statement the difficulty be the ordering of the table here vs the cascade attribute on the persister the table info get here should really be self contain i e a class representation define all the need attribute then pron could then get an array of those,0
3960, todo switch statement be always evil pron already have bug because of forget token type use polymorphism for this,0
3961, really there be two situation where pron should be ok to allow the insertion into property define on a superclass 1 union subclass with an abstract root entity 2 discrim subclass 1 be handle already because of the fact that unionsubclasspersister alreay always return 0 for this call pron may want to disallow pron for discrim subclass just for consistency sake currently do not work anyway ,0
3962, implicit join be always ok to reuse,0
3963, todo use to be exprnoparen be this need,0
3964, todo pron may also want to check that the type here map to exactly one column jdbc type can not think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi column mapping make any sense ,0
3965, pron do not know either type blind guess,0
3966, todo get sql render out of here create an ast for the join expression use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression ,0
3967, pron would probably refactor to have logicparser build a tree of simple expression connect by and or not expressionparser translate from oo term like foo foo bar foo bar baz to sql term like foos id foos bar id etc and pathexpressionparser which do much the same thing pron do now,0
3968, short circuit for performance ,0
3969, not absolutely necessary but do help with aggressive release,0
3970, try block be a hack around fact that currently tuplizer be not give the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name this allow the pron assume custom interceptor the ability to influence this decision if pron be not able to base on the give entityname,0
3971, todo this be one of the ugly and most fragile piece of code in hibernate ,0
3972, todo implement functionality this may be painful to do here as the join post processing for the subquery have already be perform mean that for theta join dialect the join condition have already be move over to the where clause a simple solution here may to perform join post processing once for the entire query include any subquerie at one fall swoop,0
3973, yuck,0
3974, ignore pron the incoming property could not be find so pron can not be sure what to do here at the very least the safe be to simply not apply any dereference toggling ,0
3975, todo make this a bit nicer,0
3976, yuck,0
3977, todo potentially look at optimize these two array,0
3978, note that i parameter be now unused delete pron,0
3979, todo figure out a well way to get the from element in a proper tree structure if this be not the destination of a many to many add pron as a child of the origin ,0
3980, todo this constructor form be only use from constructor directly below pron can pron go away,0
3981, pron should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to process a stream of token pron instead build up a tree of expression ,0
3982, todo should this get move to persistentcontext logically be persistentcontext the thing to which an interceptor get attach,0
3983, todo something much well look at the type of the other expression todo have comparisonexpression and or arithmeticexpression rule complete the resolution of boolean node ,0
3984, todo this class do too many thing pron need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent way in which path expression can occur,0
3985, todo optimize this well,0
3986, todo should pron allow suffix on these,0
3987, todo be this really necessary,0
3988, todo not sure the good way to handle this the non performant way,0
3989, todo be there a well way,0
3990, the class be now way to complex,0
3991, todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query def so as to not have to re calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset ref stuff ,0
3992, name from a super query a bit inelegant that pron show up here,0
3993, real hacky use to count the nesting of parenthesis,0
3994, put have nowait semantic be this really appropriate note that pron need to be async replication never local or sync,0
3995, ugly hack for case like element foo bar collection multi part path expression end in element or index,0
3996, fixme hacky workaround to jbcache 1202,1
3997, todo copy paste from sessionimpl pull up,0
3998, todo need to find a clean way to handle the event source role a seperate classs responsible for generate dispatching event just duplicate most of the session method pass around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext be not manageable ,0
3999, must be do here because of side effect yuck ,0
4000, pron should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expression in the most convenient way ,0
4001, todo should remove this exposure and have all reference to the session s batcher use the connectionmanager ,0
4002, pron may be screw here since the collection action be about to execute and pron do not know the final owner key value,0
4003, need the clazz check to work around union subclass todo be there a way to tell whether a persister be truly discrim column base inheritence,0
4004, work around a bug in all know connection pool ,0
4005, todo reuse the preloadevent,0
4006, need a well way to define the suffix here ,0
4007, workaround for weblogic,0
4008, todo temporary,0
4009, todo yuck fix after hhh 1907 be complete,1
4010, would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be use from the new scroll stuff would need to change the way the max row stuff be handle i e behind an interface so that pron could do the control break at the mean to know when to stop,0
4011, todo the i entityspan 1 bit depend upon subclass implementation very bad,0
4012, some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take an aliased path or a path root at the create criterion instance,0
4013, todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depend directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package ,0
4014, polymorphism not really handle completely correctly perhaps well actually pron ok assume that the entity name use in the lookup be the same as the the one use here which pron will be,0
4015, this be not very nice and quite slow,0
4016, todo get sql render out of here,0
4017, mean to handle dynamic instantiation query copy from queryloader,0
4018, make sure this be a define parameter and check the incoming value type todo what should be the actual exception type here,0
4019, worry about proxy be perhaps a little bit of overkill here ,0
4020, todo throw exception maybe warn if not the same,0
4021, todo make entitypersister not depend on sessionfactoryimplementor interface if possible,0
4022, todo what amount of significant digits need to be support here from the decimalformat doc significant digits minimum integer digits maximum fraction digit,0
4023, for backward compatibility allow a set with no not null element column use all column in the row locater sql todo create an implicit not null constraint on all col,0
4024, todo copy paste from manytoonetype,0
4025, todo code duplication with singletableentitypersister,0
4026, todo throw exception,0
4027, should this interface extend propertymapping,0
4028, todo here be why pron need to make bytecode provider global todo again fix this after hhh 1907 be complete,1
4029, todo currently keep getter and setter instead of propertyaccessors because of the way getgetter and getsetter be implement currently yuck,0
4030, todo yuck this be not quite good enough pron be a quick hack around the problem of have a to one association that refer to an embed component,0
4031, todo implement caching proxy,0
4032, be this really necessary,0
4033, todo this be a little inefficient do not need to do a whole deep replaceelement call,0
4034, todo this be a bit arbitrary expose a switch to the user,0
4035, return collection removal fixme even if isinverse true,0
4036, todo fix this so pron will work for non pojo entity mode,0
4037, todo move these to a new joinabletype abstract class extend by entitytype and persistentcollectiontype,0
4038, todo would be nice to handle proxy class elegantly,0
4039, space todo pron be not sure but perhaps pron should exclude abstract denormalized table,0
4040, todo be there a more elegant way than downcaste,0
4041, todo remove use of instanceof,0
4042, todo perhaps this should be some other runtimeexception ,0
4043, yuck,0
4044, todo need some caching scheme really come down to decision regard amount of state if any keep on propertyaccessors,0
4045, todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory,0
4046, todo pron should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerate here,0
4047, todo should this really return null if not figure out something well to do here ,0
4048, todo should seriously consider not allow a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session ,0
4049, should indicate that pron be process an insert update delete query with a subquery imply via a collection property function here pron need to use the table name pron as the qualification alia todo verify this work for all database todo be this also the case in non indexed scenario,0
4050, todo this really need to be delay unitl after pron definitively know all node type where this be currently a problem be parameter for which where pron can not unequivocally resolve an expect type,0
4051, todo make this the factory for entity mode relate session also mean make this the target of transaction synch and the thing that know how to cascade thing between related session at that point perhaps this thing be a sessioncontext and connectionmanager be a jdbccontext a sessioncontext should live in the impl package ,0
4052, create an index on the key column,0
4053, be this ok,0
4054, init the table here instead of early so that pron can get a quote table name todo would pron be well to simply pass the qualified table name instead of split pron up into schema catalog table name,0
4055, perhaps this should be an exception since pron be only ever use in the above method,0
4056, note this assume something about how propertyselectfragment be implement by the subclass be tounqotedaliasstring getdiscriminatorcolumnname before now try to remove that unqote and miss alias ,0
4057, put a placeholder in entry so pron do not recurse back and try to save the same object again question should this be do before onsave be call likewise should pron be do before onupdate,0
4058, before cascade todo should this be session instantiate persister ,0
4059, todo pron should throw an exception if pron really know for sure that this be a detached instance rather than just assume throw new staleobjectstateexception entityname pron d,0
4060, todo the order in which entity be save may matter e g a particular transient entity may need to be save before other transient entity can be save keep retry the batch of transient entity until either 1 there be no transient entity leave in transientcopycache or 2 no transient entity be save in the last batch for now just run through the transient entity and retry the merge,0
4061, todo if object be an uninitialized proxy this be inefficient result in two sql select,0
4062, todo put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second level cache need some extra work,0
4063, this be kinda the good pron can do ,0
4064, trim do to workaround stupid oracle bug that can not handle whitespace before a in a sp,0
4065, todo this nee not exclude subclass ,0
4066, todo pron use two visitor here inefficient,0
4067, todo do this really need to be here do the collection already have pron be own up to date snapshot,0
4068, otherwise a trim specification and or a trim character have be specify pron need to decide which option be present and do the right thing should lead trim character be trim should trail trim character be trim the trim character the trim source,0
4069, pron be possible that the tree walk in outerjoinloader can get to an association define by a subclass in which case the property ref may refer to a property define on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name be not know this temporary solution assume that the property ref refer to a property of the subclass table that the association belong to a reasonable guess todo fix this add outerjoinloadable getsubclasspropertytablename string propertyname,1
4070, todo an alternative be to check if the owner have change if pron have not then return collection getowner,0
4071, pron suppose,0
4072, tbd should this be varbinary 1 registercolumntype types varbinary binary 1,0
4073, shortcut,0
4074, todo pron should provide some way to get key of collection of statistic to make pron easy to retrieve from a gui perspective,0
4075, todo probably well to calculate these and pass pron in as pron will be more performant,0
4076, todo should pron additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly,0
4077, todo simply remove this override if pron fix the above todo,0
4078, todo be there really any reason to kkeep try if this fail once,0
4079, todo not sure this be correct could not find doc on how to do this ,0
4080, hsql have no blob clob support but just put these here for now,0
4081, merge do not cascade to uninitialized collection todo perhaps this do need to cascade after all ,0
4082, yick need this for proper serialization deserialization handling ,0
4083, todo should orphan really be delete during lock,0
4084, todo move to stringhelper,0
4085, set can be just a view of a part of another collection do pron need to copy pron to be sure pron will not be change underneath pron ie this set addall set,0
4086, todo pron would be really really nice to use this to also model component,0
4087, todo move to sql package,0
4088, todo look at the own property and check that pron be not lazy by instrumentation,0
4089, todo add this info to the translator and aggregate pron here ,0
4090, would be well to use the element type to determine whether the old and the new be equal here the problem be pron do not necessarily have access to the element type in all case,0
4091, todo code duplication with joinedsubclassentitypersister,0
4092, todo refactor to sql package,0
4093, todo two hashmap lookup here be one too many ,0
4094, note that this method could easily be move up to basicentitypersister if pron ever need to reuse pron from other subclass,0
4095, from the collection of association locate oja for the manytoone correspond to this persister to fully define the many to many pron need that oja so that pron can use pron alias here todo be there a well way here,0

4107, todo temporary need because currently persister be the one that create and render the join fragment for inheritence hierarchy ,0

4110, work around that crazy issue where the tree contain empty fromelements no text afaict this be cause by fromelementfactory createcollectionjoin,0
4111, kinda ugly but need for collection with a node mapping,0
4112, todo would be great to have a mapping hasnonidentifierpropertynamedid method pron do not believe that mapping getreferencedpropertytype account for the identifier property so if pron return for a property name pron d then pron should have a non pron d field name pron d,0
4113, entity name will not be available for non pojo entity todo cache the entity name somewhere so that pron be available to this exception,0
4114, index getpropertycolumnspan i todo this be kinda slow ,0

4124, use only for regression testing todo obviously get rid of all this junk,0
4125, note this assume something about how propertyselectfragment be implement by the subclass be tounqotedaliasstring getidentifercolumnnames before now try to remove that unqote and miss alias ,0
4126, todo move into collection type so pron can use polymorphism,0
4127, todo should pron just collect these like with the collection above,0
4128, todo should really move this log statement to collectiontype where this be use from ,0
4129, hum should pron cascade anyway throw an exception fine like pron be,0
4130, todo this may really even be move into the cfg package and use as the basis for all thing which be configurable ,0

4212, todo always true for now but not if pron later decide to support element in the from clause,0
4213, pron could move this inside if pron want to tolerate collection initialization during collection dirty checking,0
4214, technically incorrect here pron need to wrap null value as bsh primitive null however the this invokemethod will do that much for pron pron need to generate a conditional here to test for null and return primitive null,0
4215, look bad with the os x l f apparently ,0
4216, very subtle if pron leave this for ensurephysicallineisvisible an extra line will be add to the scroll line count ,0
4217, only work for jedit plugin,0
4218, warning null callstack here do not think pron need a stack trace to indicate how pron source the method ,0
4219, do pron matter that this do not set the type correctly,0
4220, jun 9 2004 12 40 pm waitfor hang on some java implementation ,0

4222, two plugin provide same class,0
4223, this really should be long decode but there be not one as a result hex and octal literal end in l or l do not work ,0
4224, broken class,0
4225, while pron broken to have a null symlinkpath some old plugin may ,0
4226, this be not good need a way to update eval without re instal so that pron can re eval param etc when classloader change look into this,0
4227, this seem to make nested readlock call work okay but pron have no idea if pron actually fix thing or not ,0
4228, but if hypersearch result window be float the workaround cause problem,0
4229, set the buffer s path caveat will not work if save call with a relative path but pron do not think anyone call pron like that anyway ,0
4230, todo move x should not rely on call next x time,0
4231, bug if there be multiple selection in different contexts the wrong comment string will be insert ,0
4232, fix for this bug put a mode into the user dir with the same name as one on the system dir reload edit mode old mode from system dir still use for highlight until jedit restart ,0
4233, apparently in some environment pron can not catch the security exception at all e g as an applet in ie will probably have to work around,0
4234, if pron exist remove pron and add pron at the end avoid memory leak,0
4235, race condition here ,0
4236, use special cheat that speed up the code currently about 50 but may cause problem with future maintenance and add to the class file size about 500 byte ,0
4237, original note jdk under win be throw these to warn about low case upper case possible mismatch e g bsh console bsh console update prior to 1 3 pron be squeltche noclassdeffounderrors which be very annoying pron can not reproduce the original problem and this be never a valid solution if there be legacy vm that have problem pron can include a more specific test for pron here ,0
4238, this should not happen but ,0

4243, caching be not correct and do not seem to help enclosingnamespace cacheclass name genclass,0
4244, dialog fuck thing up if a menu be visible etc new beanshellerrordialog view e,0
4245, charat index n may be unknown on a reader inputstream fixme match after a newline if in multiline mode,0
4246, this class be not very fast ,0
4247, note this method incorrectly cache the method structure pron need to be clear when the classloader change ,0
4248, xxx action bar may not be temp ,0
4249, pron wonder if the lack of this break anything in the past,0
4250, implement string value accord to the jls value may be anything in beanshell pron will disallow void undefined value or should pron map pron to the empty string,0
4251, this should be before dockable be initialize,0
4252, be this right,0
4253, should pron do this for both case above,0
4254, need to loosen this to any throwable do pron need to handle that in interpreter somewhere check first ,0
4255, fucking gtk look and feel,0
4256, note this implementation be temporary pron currently keep a flat namespace of the base name of class i e beanshell can not be in the process of define two class in different package with the same base name to remove this limitation require that pron work through namespace import in an analogous or use the same path as regular class import resolution this workaround should handle most case so pron will try pron for now ,0
4257, copy and paste from bsh classpath classmanagerimpl java ,0
4258, pron wish pron could make this friendly to only namespace,0
4259, undocumented hack to allow browser action to work xxx clean up in 4 3,1
4260, look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicate that in namespace getcommand be that ok,0
4261, this should be per instance,0
4262, can pron use the proxy mechanism to cast a bsh this to the correct interface,0
4263, redundant with constructor,0
4264, issue to resolve here 1 in which classloader should pron define the class if there be a bshclassloader should pron define pron there 2 should pron use reflection to set pron in a non bsh classloader if there be one or should pron always create a bsh classloader and expose pron defineclass,0
4265, could refactor these a bit,0
4266, note this class essentially just delegate most of pron method to pron parent the setvariable indirection be very small pron could probably fold this functionality back into the base namespace as a special case but this have change a few time so pron d like to leave this abstraction for now ,0
4267, simplify these setting a little ,0
4268, should check for strict java here and use isjavaassignable instead,0
4269, workaround for swing render label start with html use the html engine,0
4270, look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicate that in this java should pron call on this can never be a command,0
4271, this method be a nightmare,0
4272, consoleinterface the interpreter reflexively implement the console interface that pron use should clean this up by use an inner class to implement the console for pron ,0
4273, case insensitive f workaround,0
4274, wrap null this be a bit of a cludge to address a deficiency in the class generator whereby pron do not wrap null on method delegate see class generator java if pron fix that then pron can remove this just have to generate the code there ,0
4275, switch eat a multi level break here not empty statement,0
4276, check for field on object note could eliminate throw the exception somehow,0
4277, xxxx re evaluate this can getsuper work by pron now if pron be a class instance and the parent be also a class instance then super mean pron parent ,0
4278, pron wish protect access be limit to child and not also package scope pron want this to be a singleton implement by various child ,0
4279, import full name be not find as an absolute class if pron be compound try to resolve to an inner class maybe this should happen in the bshclassmanager,0
4280, can not this be combine with run run seem to have stuff in pron for interactive vs non interactive compare pron side by side and see what pron do differently aside from the exception handle ,0
4281, null value be just a declaration note pron may want to keep any exist value here instead of reset,0
4282, can this be factor out should be be add the l here instead,0
4283, catch the mismatch and continue to try the next note this be innefficient should have an isassignablefrom that do not throw,0
4284, should use try finally here to pop ns,0
4285, note this could be make clear by add an inner class for the case and an object context for the child traversal ,0
4286, hack stick to first interpreter that resolve this see comment on type instance variable,0
4287, note incorrect here pron be use the hack in bsh class manager that allow lookup by base name pron need to eliminate this limitation by work through import see note in class manager ,0
4288, this be the namespace in which the method be set pron be a back reference for the node which need to execute under this namespace pron be not necessary to declare this transient because pron can only be save as part of pron namespace anyway currently ,0
4289, replace this be cocoa api call later,0
4290, scripting class currently require accessibility this can be eliminate with a bit more work ,0
4291, this could be static,0
4292, thank to slava pestov of jedit fame for import caching enhancement note this class have get too big pron should be break down a bit ,0
4293, register an attribute declaration for later retrieval format string type string default value int value type todo do something with attribute type ,0
4294, todo to get cast and boxing working e g e g byte ia 1 2 if the basetype be a wrapper type then pron need to get the primitive type class for the base type here in order for the cast to allow pron then boxing will happen naturally in the array set e g integer ia 1 2,0
4295, note pron will will move this behavior out to a subclass of namespace but pron will start here ,0
4296, this be a particularly nasty bit of code that check for a parameter entity reference but peek ahead to catch the in parameter entity declaration ,0
4297, should cache this subject to classloader change message evaluation of the formal parameter simply resolve pron type via the specify namespace pron do not modify the namespace ,0
4298, notes pron would not be hard to eliminate the use of org objectweb asm type from this class make the distribution a tiny bit small ,0
4299, stupid caret will automatically be incremente,0
4300, spacing workaround,0
4301, pron do not know of any other way to fix this since invoke this command from a menu result in the focus owner be the menu until the menu go away ,0
4302, a little hack for reverse replace and find,0
4303, static method that operate on compound separate name pron guess pron could move these to stringutil someday,0
4304, note which of these thing should be check at parse time vs run time,0
4305, this part suck,0
4306, windows bug workaround in case a yes no confirm be show,0
4307, clear name resolver do not know if this be necessary ,0
4308, this be stupid and misleading but path be not use anywhere except the above line and if this be do after the continue then pron will either hang or be force to duplicate pron inside the buffer null or add a finally clause pron decide which one be bad ,0
4309, pron be too tired to think of a well way to handle this right now ,0
4310, hack bufferiorequest to send vfsupdate in case two stage save be off now ,0
4311, some other primitive should avoid call method on primitive as pron do in name can not treat primitive like an object message but the hole be useful right now ,0
4312, change the parent which be the class static to the class instance pron really need to check if pron be a static inner class here first but for some reason java will not show the static modifier on pron fake inner class could generate a flag field ,0
4313, this be where check exception piss pron off this method only use a stringreader which can never throw an exception ,0
4314, if any subexpression do not terminate pron do not count todo check if this code ever get hit,0
4315, parse pattern into token do anyone know if pron be more efficient to use char than a string charat pron be assume so ,0
4316, note object be only use here for precondition get rid of pron,0
4317, why both of these,0
4318, cut off from parent pron must have pron own class manager can not do this in the run command need to resolve stuff should pron do pron by default when pron create a namespace will no parent of class manager,0
4319, note the bsh command code should probably not be here pron need to scope pron by the namespace that import the command so pron probably need to be integrate into namespace ,0
4320, this could be smart ,0
4321, pron be explicitly import but pron do not know what pron be should pron throw an error here,0
4322, note pron need a form of eval that pass the callstack through ,0
4323, primary interpreter set and get variable method note these be squeltche error should pron,0
4324, workaround for jdk bug 4071281 where system in available return too large a value this bug have be fix in jdk 1 2 ,1
4325, somewhat of a hack if the special field be visible pron be operate relative to a this type already dissallow far this reference to prevent user from skip to thing like super this caller,0
4326, should clean this up to a single return statement,0
4327, implementation note note pron may need some synchronization in here note on version dependency this base class be jdk 1 1 compatible however pron be force to use weak reference in the full featured implementation the optional bsh classpath package to accomodate all of the fleeting namespace listener as pron fall out of scope namespaces must be inform if the class space change so that pron can un cache name p perhaps a simple idea would be to have entity that reference cached type always perform a light weight check with a counter reference value and use that to detect change in the namespace this put the burden on the consumer to check at appropriate time but could eliminate the need for the listener system in many place and the necessity of weak reference in this package p,0
4328, note this impor pattern be become common could factor pron out into an importedobject vector class ,0
4329, not sure if pron should really recurse here for explicitly import class in parent ,0
4330, the follow two boolean check be tack on this could probably be smooth out ,0
4331, notes this be break pron find public but less specific method over non public but more specific one findmostspecficmethod need to be rewrite to eliminate findaccessiblemethod pron should implement the findmostspecificmethod that use the publiconly flag findmostspecificmethod should also operate in two pass to give standard java assignable match priority over extended bsh type match ,0
4332, unixworkaround constructor,0
4333, drag and drop support pron d just move the code to jedittextarea but pron depend on jdk 1 4 api,0
4334, next version remove this,1
4335, compatibility kludge for jedit 3 1 and early,0
4336, stupid scrollbar policy be an attempt to work around bug people have be see with ibm s jdk 7 sep 2000,0
4337, this be a weird hack pron do not want c e a to insert a in the search bar if the search bar have focus ,0
4338, aha this be probably the only way to fix this,0
4339, this be a dirty hack and pron rely on the fact that update for parent be send before update for the change node pron if this be not the case the browser would not be update properly on delete etc to avoid cause 1 request error do not reload directory if request already active,0
4340, pron consume this to work around the bug where a tab window switching activate the menu bar on windows ,0
4341, pron guess translate event do not have the evt field set so consume will not work pron do not think this be a problem as nothing use translation anyway,0
4342, this be a hack and really need to be do well ,0
4343, copy and paste from resyntaxmatcher to make syntax package independent of jedit pron,0
4344, stupidity,0
4345, this do not seem very correct but pron fix a problem when set the initial caret position for a buffer eg from the recent file list,0
4346, do not try this at home,0
4347, silly that pron reference the vertical scroll bar here directly pron do this so that the horizontal scroll bar be flush with the vertical scroll bar,0
4348, xxx clean up this conditional,0
4349, temporary hack to support inner class if the obj be a non static inner class then import the context this be not a sufficient emulation of inner class replace this later ,0
4350, workaround for swing s annoying processing of label start with html which often break,0
4351, fucking gtk look and feel,0
4352, hack so that select all do not change current buffer,0
4353, if an occurence occur at the beginning of the selection the selection start will get move this suck so pron hack to avoid pron ,0
4354, silly bug workaround 8694 if pron look at the above code note that pron restore the save caret position first then scroll to the saved location however the caret change can pron result in scroll to a different location than what be save and since movecaretposition call updatebrackethighlight the bracket highlight s out of bound calculation will rely on a different set of physical first last line than what pron will end up with eventually instead of confuse the user with status message that appear at random when switch buffer pron simply hide the message altogether ,1
4355, this be a sloppy hack to fix bug 677902 hit return after collapse fold the idea be that if pron extend the range then the problem describe in the bug happend so if the insert be at the very end of the range pron do not extend pron instead pron push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly pron also have to mess with screen line count ,1
4356, need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack to work,0
4357, xxx if pron keep the createclassmanager in getclassmanager then pron can axe this,0
4358, note this class be messy the method and field resolution nee to be rewrite various method in here catch nosuchmethod or nosuchfield exception during pron search these should be rewrite to avoid have to catch the exception method lookup be now cache at a high level so pron be less important however the logic be messy ,0
4359, the soon ppl move to the new api the less pron will need crap like this,0
4360, nasty hardcoded value,0
4361, strip off drive letter review would a well check be file separator ,0
4362, xxx magic number,0
4363, workaround for uncooperative windows l f,0
4364, have to do this hack until vfspath class be write,0
4365, stupid swing,0
4366, none of the other be ever mean to be remove retarded eh this need to be fix eventually for plugin may want to do weird stuff to jedit s ui,0
4367, this be retarded excuse pron while pron drool and make stupid noise,0
4368, retarded gtk look and feel,0
4369, should probably error,0
4370, there must be a well way of fix this the problem be that this method can sometimes be call as a result of a text area scroll event in which case the caret position have not be update yet ,0
4371, perhaps here pron would want to guard with a property for parallel backup or not ,0
4372, this be such a bad way of do pron but oh well ,0
4373, while this may be questionable some menu depend on property,0
4374, get available screen o n 3 this be nasty but since pron be not dealle with many item pron should be fine,0
4375, method that really should not be public ,0
4376, unixworkaround class,0
4377, perhaps if xerces be not slightly brain damage pron would not need this,0
4378, move to guiutilitie as pron make no sense be here ,0

4384, why be object in the arg,0
4385, should implement getminimumlength any idea,0
4386, move pron to classpath classmanagerimpl,0
4387, pron never teach pron this in undergrad computer science,0
4388, should pron cache info in not a class case too,0
4389, wtf,0
4390, xxx hairy code that be basically just a functional port of some other code i barely understand,0

4394, this feel sloppy especially for non u s locale ,0
4395, hack to get fix length length field,0
4396, pron have to deal with assembly the programmer can be write little 32 byte chunk for all pron know and pron must assemble complete record for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying ,0
4397, hack do to fix bring the window to the front at least on window frame tofront do not cut pron remove the iswindow check if pron be break under other oses too ,0
4398, this method should be rewrite to use getfields and avoid catch exception during the search ,0
4399, hack ,0
4400, this should probably be in reflect java,0
4401, note see note on findmostspecificmethod this method should be roll into findmostspecificmethod ,0
4402, note be use signaturekey in this way dangerous in the pathological case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of argument type to an untyped method maybe pron could be smart about pron by ignore the type of untyped parameter position the method resolver could return a set of hint for the signature key caching there be also the overhead of create one of these for every method dispatch what be the alternative,0
4403, crusty workaround,0
4404, workaround for a key produce garbage on windows,0
4405, addtofavorite which be a static method for convinience need an instance of the vfs to pass to vfsmanager sendvfsupdate hence this hack ,0
4406, allow getthis to work through blocknamespace to the method namespace xxx re eval this do pron need pron,0
4407, these be use to eliminate code duplication i do not normally use the visitor or template method pattern but this code be contribute by peter cox and i do not feel like change pron around too much ,0
4408, fuck pron dead,0
4409, stupid hack to handle reference a rule set that be define later,0
4410, jdk 1 4 workaround,1
4411, should the next two be public maybe,0
4412, note this method and resolveexpectedjavafield should be rewrite to invert this logic so that no exception need to be catch unecessarily this be just a temporary impl return the field or null if not find,0
4413, note pron need a singleton here so that thing like this this work and probably a good idea for speed cache a single instance here seem technically incorrect consider the declaringinterpreter could be different under some circumstance case a child interpreter run a source eval command however the effect be just that the main interpreter that execute pron script should be the one involved in call back from java pron do not know if there be corner case where a child interpreter would be the first to use a this reference in a namespace or if that would even cause any problem if pron do pron could do some experiment to find out and if necessary pron could cache on a per interpreter basis if pron have weak reference pron may also look at skip over child interpreter and go to the parent for the declare interpreter so pron d be sure to get the top interpreter ,0
4414, resolve relative to a class type static field inner class,0
4415, some regexps eg by pron have a length 0 so pron implement this hack if pron do not understand what be go on here then go back to watch mtv,0
4416, optimization if classofstaticmethod be set then pron have already be here and determine that this be a static method invocation note maybe factor this out with path below clean up ,0
4417, this will probably not get use object type,0
4418, windows jdk workaround,0
4419, this listener priority thing be a bad hack ,0
4420, this do not look pretty and mode line should probably be split up into seperate component string,0
4421, this be stupid and misleading but path be not use anywhere except the above line and if this be do after the continue then pron will either hang or be force to duplicate pron inside the buffer null or add a finally clause pron decide which one be bad ,0
4422, workaround for hang if match be zero width not sure if there be a well way to handle this,0
4423, on windows path of the form x list the last working directory on that drive to list the root of the drive pron must use x however the vfs browser and friend strip off trail path separator for various reason so to work around that pron add a to drive letter path on windows ,0
4424, on unix set permission of port file to rw so that on broken unice which give everyone read access to user home dir people can not see pron port file and hence send arbitriary beanshell code pron way nasty ,0
4425, this should only be call with fully load action set,0
4426, break eclipse workaround 24 febuary 2004,0
4427, notes this be break pron find public but less specific method over non public but more specific one this method need to be rewrite to eliminate findaccessiblemethod pron should implement the findmostspecificmethod that use the publiconly flag findmostspecificmethod should also operate in two pass to give standard java assignable match priority over extended bsh type match ,0
4428, xxx this should not be hardcode,0
4429, interval operator x x x y re intervals re no bk brace x x x y re intervals re no bk brace open question what be proper interpretation of at start of string,0
4430, xxx do this really belong here,0
4431, pron do need to save every possible point but the number of clone invocation here be really a killer for performance on non stingy repeat operator pron be open to suggestion ,0

4499, fixme this attribute be not use deprecate,0
4500, todo by code the event with some information about what change in the dataset pron could make the recalculation of the interval more efficient in some case for instance if the change be just an update to a y value then the x interval do not need updating ,0
4501, the method pron want be not in the categoryitemrenderer interface ,0
4502, fixme what if value be null on next line,0

4506, unused but must return something so while pron be at pron ,0
4507, fixme perhaps pron should clone the data list,0
4508, if pron be render the value as percentage pron need to calculate the total for the current item unfortunately here pron end up repeat the calculation more time than be strictly necessary hopefully pron will come back to this and find a way to add the total s to the renderer state the other problem be pron implicitly assume the dataset have no negative value perhaps that can be fix too ,0
4509, note pron would be nice to pre calculate this per series,0
4510, pron assume that all other paint instance implement equal and hashcode of course that may not be true but what can pron do about pron,0
4511, fixme use other field too,0
4512, all attribute be immutable so pron can just return the super clone fixme in fact the generator pron be immutable so cloning be not necessary,0
4513, here be a quirk the api have be define in term of a plain timeperiod which can not make use of the timezone and locale specify in the constructor so pron only do the time zone peg if the period be an instanceof regulartimeperiod,0
4514, now handle specific plot type and yes pron know this be some really ugly code that have to be manually update any time a new plot type be add pron should have write something much cool but pron do not and neither do anyone else ,0

4558, todo pron loose encode information here fix pron,0
4559, todo pron should use implicit nil for body but problem punt til later,0
4560, todo numeric new work in ruby and pron do here too however try to use that instance in a numeric operation should generate an argumenterror do this seem so pathological pron do not see the need to fix this now ,0

4564, fixme for some reason this dispatcher cause a verifyerror classclass dispatcher callbackfactory createdispatcher classclass,0
4565, fixme pron doubt any of the constant reference in this method be ever redefine should compare to the know value rather than do an expensive constant lookup ,0
4566, todo rewriter and compiler assume case when empty expression in mri this be just a when assert casenode null casenode be not null,0
4567, todo do not require pop,0
4568, xxx wrong but will have to do for now,0
4569, get value from current scope or one of pron capture scope fixme block variable be not get prime to nil so pron need to null check those until pron prime pron properly also add assert back in param offset zero indexed value that represent where variable live param depth how many capture scope down this variable should be set return the value here,0
4570, important receive the block argument before the opt and splat arg this be so that the arg can be encode as rest of the array this will not work if the block argument have not be receive yet,0
4571, fixme pron get a bunch of npe when pron do not check for null here how,0
4572, sss fixme there be also difference in variable scoping between 1 8 and 1 9 ruby 1 8 be the buggy semantic if pron understand correctly the semantic of how this shadow other variable outside the block need to be figure out during live var analysis ,0
4573, this be a getopt with one mandatory arg but pron do not work so pron be parse pron for now ,0
4574, this be the result of a bug that leave off all trail argument e g system ls 1 dir would be see as system ls,0
4575, fixme broken but behave,0
4576, todo pron overflow on large file pron could increase to long to limit this but then the impl get more involved since java io apis base on int mean pron have to chunk up a long into a series of int op ,0
4577, if pron outgrow pron pushback stack then grow pron this should only happen in pretty pathological case ,0
4578, fixme arg may also be true false and nil and still be valid strangely enough protocol conversion be not happen in ruby on this arg,0
4579, todo proper sign,0
4580, todo in mri 1 9 an explicit check for negative length be add here indexerror be raise when length be negative see ruby core 12953 for more detail new note this be actually under re evaluation see ruby core 17483 ,0
4581, enebo very wrong,0
4582, fixme if pron terminate immediately this appear to break while in method argument pron need to push a nil for the case where pron will never enter the body,0
4583, the follow constant capture pre know static call site jruby implementation of method of ruby class sss fixme note that compiler impl basebodycompiler be use op match2 for match and and op match for match2 be this a bug there,0
4584, sss fixme this do not preserve original order of when clause pron could consider preserve the order or maybe not since pron would have to sort the constant first in any case for output jump table in certain situation add body to map for emit later,0
4585, sss fixme why be the for node be build use closure and not as a regular loop with branch this have implication on inlining implementation of closure next break etc when each and the block pron consume be inline together in the caller the loop from the each should become a normal loop without any closure but in this implementation of for pron replace one closure with another,0
4586, synchronized method per jruby 1173 unsafe double checked locking fixme synchronization be still wrong in cp code,1
4587, vulture thread will periodically expunge dead entry entry be also expunge during put operation this be design to cover the case where many object be create initially follow by limited put activity fixme disabled below pende resolution of finalization issue,0
4588, fixme pron be assume that original string will be raw byte if ku be provide this will not be true but that be ok for now deal with that when someone need pron ,0
4589, todo ruby lock the string here,0
4590, todo rubicon testkernel die without this line a cursory glance imply pron falsely set to nil and this set pron back to something valid this should get fix at the same time pron address bug 1296484 ,1

4613, fixme throw the right argumenterror s if the class be miss or if pron be a module ,0
4614, fixme this be not quite right pron should not evaluate the value if pron be go to throw the error,0

4628, sss fixme verify semantic of this instruction,0
4629, pron basically ignore protocol let someone report pron ,0
4630, sss fixme be this correct,0
4631, fixme pron use a for block to implement end node because pron need a proc which capture pron enclosing scope forblock now represent these node and should be rename ,0
4632, sss fixme 1 be the order correct poll before next,0
4633, pron use a highly uncommon string to represent the paragraph delimiter 100 soln not worth pron,0
4634, add a self recv here todo be this right,0
4635, todo mri behavior call or add depend on the call but this lead to exception when float be add see http blade nagaokaut ac jp cgi bin scat rb ruby ruby core 17374 return callcoerce context op b true this be mri behavior pron will use pron for now thus provide an ability to add float ,1
4636, sss fixme be this correctly place at the end of the loop iteration,0
4637, todo ruby reuse this logic for other write behavior by check if pron be an io and call write again,0
4638, sss fixme where do this go m setlineposition arraynode getposition,0
4639, pron would be nice and logical if exponent form behave like e e and decimal form behave like f but no such luck hence,0
4640, sss fixme these should get normally compile or initialize some other way sss fixme parent super type info be incorrect these be just placeholder for now this need to be update with real class object later,0
4641, todo not allocatable allocator be probably ok here confirm jruby 415,1
4642, sss fixme pron could make ir loop a scope too semantically pron be a scope but functionally not sure if this be require yet ,0
4643, this cover the rare case of low case class name and thus will fail 99 999 of the time fortunately pron will only do this once per package name and seriously folk look into good practice ,0
4644, sss fixme should this be a string literal or a string dummy class for the script,0
4645, todo should this be deprecate to be efficient internal should deal with rubyhash directly,0
4646, sss fixme do int suffice or do pron need long,0
4647, module be include with a shim class pron must find that shim to handle super appropriately,0
4648, reset value map if this instruction be the start end of a basic block right now call be consider hard boundary for optimization and information can not be propagate across pron sss fixme rather than treat all call with a broad brush what pron need be to capture different attribute about a call use closure know call target can modify scope etc this information be probably already present in the ast inspector,0
4649, todo determine whether pron should perhaps store non singleton class in the implementationclass,0
4650, sss fixme correct where do closure arg come from,0
4651, fixme consider fix node assign pron rather than single case,0
4652, sss fixme should pron have a reference to the ir loop that be be retry,0
4653, temporary hack to handle non ruby value will come up with well solution shortly,0
4654, simplify the variable too to keep these variable in sync with what be actually use in the when clause this be not require for correctness reason but only for performance reason ,0
4655, must be call from main thread pron be currently but this bother pron,0
4656, con fixme pron do not know how to make case be an expression do that logic need to go here,0
4657, fixme legal here may want unsupportedoperationexception,0
4658, fixme this be an ugly hack to resolve jruby 1381 pron be not proud of pron,0
4659, something wrong pron do not know the cwd todo be this behavior really desirable mov,0
4660, todo no java stringity,0
4661, fixme total hack to get flash in rails marshalling unmarshalle in session ok pron need to totally change marshalling to work with overridden core class ,0
4662, todo this method be not present in mri,0
4663, fixme ideally javaobject instance should be marshallable which mean that the javaobject metaclass should have an appropriate allocator jruby 414,1
4664, todo public only,0
4665, fixme this should probably do some translation from ruby priority level to java priority level until pron have green thread,0
4666, todo consider a well way of synchronizing,0
4667, use ioinputstream may not be the most performance way but pron be easy ,0
4668, fixme pron should not be regenerate this over and over,0
4669, xxx this check previously use callmethod to check for equality between class when scan the hierarchy however the check may be safe pron should only ever have one instance bind to a give type constant if pron be find to be unsafe examine way to avoid the call ,0
4670, todo why be pron duplicate the constant here and then in file constant below file constant be include in io ,0
4671, a cloned method now belong to a new class set pron todo make dynamicmethod immutable,0
4672, todo these be miss so pron be not handle pron elsewhere,0
4673, todo cache,0
4674, fixme wtf be this why would these use the class,0
4675, todo figure out how this can happen and possibly remove,0
4676, fixme pron do not like this,0
4677, fixme these description should probably be move out to constantine project which deal with all platform dependent constant ,0
4678, fixme this below be temporary but pron much safe for cow pron prevent not share string with begin 0 this allow now e g bytelist set not to be begin aware,0
4679, todo what about n arg,0
4680, fixme pron think this chunk be equivalent to mri id2name and not pron public method id2name make into method if use more than once ,0
4681, fixme this be probably not very efficient since pron load all method for each call,0
4682, hack in to replace usual readline with this,0
4683, if pron get here pron find a matching method use pron todo choose narrow method by continue to search,0
4684, todo this be kinda gross,0
4685, fixme in order for thread to play well with the standard new behavior pron must provide an allocator that can create empty object instance which initialize then fill with appropriate datum ,0
4686, these extra array be really unfortunate split some of these path out to eliminate,0
4687, pron clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block any previously capture instance of this block may still be around and pron do not want to start overwrite those value when pron create a new one enebo once pron make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable pron can remove duplicate,0
4688, todo protect method this be go to require a rework of some of the mechanism ,0
4689, if not overload pron add a method that guess at which signature to use todo just add first one right now add in signature guess logic,0
4690, sss fixme this should never get call for constant svalue,0
4691, todo this version be well than the hackish previous one windows behavior need to be define though pron suppose this version could be improve more too todo etc passwd be also inadequate for macosx since pron do not use etc passwd for regular user account,0
4692, fixme there be some code duplication here with rubyobject inspect,0
4693, for visibility checking without require frame self todo do not bother pass when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately,0
4694, fixme figure out why pron get null sometimes,0
4695, hacky advance position to eat newline here ,0
4696, need to reexamine this,0
4697, fixme this be currently only here because of some problem with iooutputstream write to a bare runtime without a proper scope,0
4698, workaround for jruby 4149,1
4699, use iooutputstream may not be the most performance way but pron be easy ,0
4700, ignore bean do not get register todo why do that bother pron,0
4701, enebo lots of optz in 1 9 parser here,0
4702, fixme move out of this class,0
4703, in fact pron should probably raise an error yes,0
4704, todo ary sort check should be do here,0
4705, todo get rid of this lax return 0 0 strict will throw,0
4706, bit risky if someone change completor but useful for method call,0
4707, todo the rest of this seek to same position be unnecessary since pron share a channel but some of this may be need,0
4708, todo be this the right thing to do,0
4709, fixme this probably belong in a different package ,0
4710, fixme not very efficient,0
4711, this be gross but java api s be not iso 8601 compliant at all,0
4712, todo be this correct,0
4713, workaround for jruby 2326 mri do not enter this production for some reason,1
4714, create block for this iter node fixme pron should not use the current scope if pron be not actually from the same hierarchy of static scope,0
4715, sss fixme do pron need to check if l be same as whatever pop,0
4716, sss fixme where be this set up how be this diff from classvardeclnode,0
4717, fixme do pron need the check or do main java not call this pron should consolidate,0
4718, fixme this table will get move into posix library so pron can get all actual support signal this be a quick fix to support basic signal until that happen ,0
4719, fixme this worry pron a bit since pron could allocate a lot with a large newlength,0
4720, todo this filtering be kind of gross pron would be nice to get some parser help here,0
4721, todo decompose getjavapackagemodule so pron do not parse fullname,0
4722, fixme get rid of laziness and handle restrict access elsewhere,0
4723, todo for now pron use a faithful reimplementation of mri s algorithm but should use utf8encode facility from joni once pron start prefrome utf 8 content validation ,0
4724, if pron do not have opt arg start after arg pron will be assign later this be for crap like def foo a b true 1 which number b before a fixme only start after require arg since opt arg may access other and rest arg conflict with compileroot use 0 to indicate signature ,0
4725, fixme determine if a real allocator be need here do people want to extend javaclass do pron want pron to do that can pron class new javaclass should pron be able to todo not allocatable allocator be probably ok here since pron do not intend for people to monkey with this type and pron can not be marshal confirm jruby 415,1
4726, grrr arghh want to subclass sun misc floatingdecimal but can not so pron must do all this the next 70 line of code which have already be do by floatingdecimal ,0
4727, fixme do pron really want declare method include private protect and do not include superclass method also the getdeclare call may throw securityexception if pron be run under a restrictive security policy ,0
4728, small hack to save a cast later on,0
4729, this be perhaps innefficient timewise optimal spacewise,0
4730, todo confirm expect arg be irubyobject or similar,0
4731, there be not a compelling reason to keep javaclass instance in a weak map any proxy create be be keep in a non weak map so in most case pron will stick around anyway and some good reason not to javaclass creation be expensive for one many lookup be perform when pass parameter to from method etc todo fast custom concurrent map,0
4732, todo check for java reserve name and raise exception if encounter,0
4733, fixme jruby 3188 end up with condition return null quick fix until pron can dig into pron,1
4734, workaround for a bug in sun s jdk 1 5 x see http bugs sun com bugdatabase view bug do bug pron d 6303753,1
4735, fixme weakref rb also do caller 2 here for the backtrace,0
4736, fixme remove this from grammar ,0
4737, todo pron be perhaps just a coincidence that all the channel for which pron should raise be instanceof selectablechannel since stdio be not so this bother pron slightly con,0
4738, fixme not sure what the semantic of transfer be cfiber definefastmethod transfer cb getfastoptmethod transfer,0
4739, fixme this be pretty gross pron should have a clean initialization that do not depend on package visible field and ideally be atomic probably use an immutable structure pron replace all at once lazy null when no group define,0
4740, this be a dummy scope pron should find a way to make that more explicit,0
4741, fixme resolve what the hell be go on,0
4742, rb obj pron d return the internal pron d of an object fixme should this be rename to match pron ruby name,0
4743, again should not happen todo may want to throw exception instead ,0
4744, fixme maybe not good place but move pron to a good home,0
4745, todo not allocatable allocator may be ok here but pron be unclear how structs work with marshalling confirm behavior and ensure pron be do this correctly jruby 415,1
4746, todo should next and return also catch here,0
4747, pron always prepend an org jruby proxy package to the beginning because java and javax package be protect and sign jar prevent pron generate new class with those package name see jruby 2439 ,1
4748, todo pron should be able to optimize this quite a bit post 1 0 javaclass already have all the method organize by method name the next version support protect method field will have pron organize even far so collectmethod here can just lookup the overridden method in the javaclass map should be much fast ,0
4749, index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assign arg past the end,0
4750, todo make more efficient by not create irubyarray,0
4751, rb mod remove cvar fixme any good reason to have two identical method same as remove class variable,0
4752, from dup setup rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here unlikely ,0
4753, if pron be a single arg when but contain an array pron know pron be a real literal array fixme this be a gross way to figure pron out parser help similar to yield argument pass expandargument would be well,0
4754, todo only setaccessible to account for pattern find by access constant include from a non public interface aka java util zip zipconstant be implement by many class,0
4755, not intend to be call directly by user private old todo from ruby code this should be implement in javaclass java where pron can check for reserved ruby name conflict method etc ,0
4756, fixme do not allow multiple thread to do this at once,0
4757, todo bleed runtime into parser arity may be should be in parser to keep bleed oneway,0
4758, rb ary push m fixme whis be this name push m,0
4759, todo this probably be not the good hack but pron work until pron can have different root frame setup for 1 9 easily ,1
4760, todo at least parsersupport attrset pass argsnode as null implicitnil be wrong magic for setuparg since pron will irubyobject nil so pron need to figure out a nice fast null pattern for setuparg assert argsnode null receivernode be not null,0
4761, hack in order to have stdout err act like ttys and flush always pron set anything assign to stdout stderr to sync,0
4762, todo people extend gzipwriter reader will break find well way here ,0
4763, fixme set up a call configuration for this,0
4764, process stream get channel newchannel ed into filechannel but be not actually seekable so instead of just the isseekable check do instanceof filechannel pron must also add this boolean to check which pron set to false when pron be know that the incoming channel be from a process fixme this be gross and pron be nio s fault for not provide a nice way to tell if a channel be really seekable ,0
4765, fixme somehow pron d feel well if this could get the appropriate var index from the argumentnode,0
4766, fixme can get optimize for ieqlnode,0
4767, todo round mode should not be hard code see mode ,0
4768, fixme move this here to get what be obviously a utility method out of irubyobject perhaps security method should find pron own centralized home at some point ,0
4769, fixme if nativeexception be expect to be use from ruby code pron should provide a real allocator to be use otherwise class new will fail as will marshalling jruby 415,1
4770, object to a be obsolete pron match ruby s hack until to a go away then pron can remove this hack too ,0
4771, todo callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost constant be rarely assign,0
4772, fixme this should go somewhere more generic maybe idutil,0
4773, sss fixme move this code to some util area or probably there be already a method for this in some jruby util class holy cow just to append two darned array,0
4774, todo set pron metaclass to target s class i e scary,0
4775, add new with full signature so pron be guarantee to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature,0
4776, context be null wipe out the softreference this could be do with a reference queue,0
4777, todo remove,0
4778, fixme big fat hack here because scope name be expect to be intern string by the parser,0
4779, todo this be actually now return the scope of whoever call method to proc which be obviously wrong but there be no scope to provide for many method pron fix jruby 2237 but need a well solution ,1
4780, author headius fixme convert to enum,0
4781, the follow three method must be define fast since pron expect to modify the current frame i e pron expect no frame will be allocate for pron jruby 1185 ,1
4782, todo not allocatable allocator be probably ok here since pron do not intend for people to monkey with this type and pron can not be marshal confirm jruby 415,1
4783, sss fixme can this return anything other than nil,0
4784, xxx const lookup can trigger const missing be that enough to warrant pron always be execute,0
4785, todo should frozen error have pron own distinct class if not should more share,0
4786, todo only use by interface implementation eliminate pron,0
4787, fixme null check be removable once pron figure out how to assign to unset name block arg,0
4788, for jruby 2759 when met choose cet timezone to work around joda,1
4789, fixme this be gross do not do this ,0
4790, fixme pron think pron need these push somewhere,0
4791, sss fixme deprecated go forward all instruction should come from the cfg,0
4792, todo should probably apply the null object pattern for a non allowed class rather than null,0
4793, yow this be still ugly,0
4794, add method with full signature so pron be guarantee to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature,0
4795, fixme this version be fast than the previous but both suffer from a crucial flaw pron be impossible to create an objectspace with an iterator that do not either a hold on to object that may otherwise be collect or b have no way to guarantee that a call to hasnext will be correct or that a subsequent call to next will produce an object for pron purpose for now this may be acceptable ,0
4796, fixme clearing read buffer here be this appropriate,0
4797, todo specify soft ref may want to compare memory consumption behavior with weak ref specify weak in place of soft below,0
4798, fixme lose syntactical element here and other like this,0
4799, enebo totally weird naming in mri be not allocate and be a local var name,0
4800, fixme this do not actually support anything but string,0
4801, up to ten stuff into tmp local load in reverse order and assign fixme there be probably a slightly smart way but be pron important,0
4802, xxx do something,0
4803, todo only setaccessible to account for pattern find by access constant include from a non public interface aka java util zip zipconstant be implement by many class todo not sure pron need this at all since pron only expose public field field setaccessible true,0
4804, fixme pron want to eliminate these type cast when possible,0
4805, hack force clinit to be create,0
4806, fixme if true array be common enough pron should pre allocate and stick somewhere,0
4807, optional arg so pron have irubyobject todo confirm,0
4808, todo this be almost rubymodule instance method on the metaclass perhaps refactor ,0
4809, fixme add this because marshal spec seem to reconstitute object without call datawrapstruct this result in object be null after unmarshalle ,0
4810, todo factor this chunk as in mri yarv getaster,0
4811, exit monitor before make call fixme this not be in a finally be a little worrisome,0
4812, self arg 0 sss fixme verify that this be correct,0
4813, this be for jruby 2988 since after a suspend the terminal seem to need to be reinitialize since pron can not easily detect suspension initialize after every readline probably not fast but this be for interactive terminal anyway so who care,1
4814, todo do above but not below for additional newline node,0
4815, sss fixme receiver this be the class meta object basically operand receiver build defsnode getreceivernode s,0
4816, fixme this whole thing could probably be implement as a module and mix into appropriate class especially if pron use either ioinput outputstream or be smart about the kind of io like object pron be be use against ,0
4817, fixme bit of a kludge here non interface class assign to both class and module field simplify proxy extender code will go away when ji be overhaul and proxy extender be deprecate ,0
4818, fixme what should these really be numeric assert x instanceof rubycomplex y instanceof rubycomplex,0
4819, pron be depend on the side effect of the load which load the class but do not turn pron into a script pron do not like pron but until pron restructure the code a bit more pron will need to quietly let pron by here ,0
4820, fixme pron should also support org that use capitalize package name include embarrassingly the one pron work for but this should be enable by a system property as the expected default behavior for an upper case value should be and be to treat pron as a class name and raise an exception if pron be not find,0
4821, todo this version differ from ioctl by check whether fcntl exist and raise notimplemente if pron do not perhaps no difference for pron,0
4822, fixme this be temporary since the variable compiler assume pron want arg already on stack for assignment pron just pop and continue with 1 9 arg logic ,0
4823, todo eliminate,0
4824, todo handle write into original buffer better,0
4825, this be a fairly specific hack for empty string but pron do the job,0
4826, xxx this constructor be a hack to implement the end syntax convert a reader back into an inputstream do not generally work ,0
4827, method have more than 500 line pron will need to split pron and therefore need to use a heap base scope,0
4828, the implementation of these be all bonus see todo above pron be go to throw an error from these but pron appear to be the wrong place to do pron ,0
4829, entry exist proxy do not match replace this could happen if old proxy be gc ed todo raise exception if store proxy be non null not gc ed,0
4830, todo well algorithm to set precision need,0
4831, sss fixme use anywhere pron do not see call to this anywhere public operand builddasgnassignment node node ir scope s dasgnnode dasgnnode dasgnnode node s getvariablecompiler assignlocalvariable dasgnnode getindex dasgnnode getdepth,0
4832, todo make this more intelligible value,0
4833, todo split this into two sub class so that name and constnode can be specify seperately ,0
4834, not sure how well this work but pron work much well than just currenttimemillis by pron ,0
4835, fixme this be copy code from rubyarray both re struct and array should share one impl this be also hacky since pron construct ruby object to access ruby array through aref instead of something low ,0
4836, fixme no pron do not like pron ,0
4837, argument compiler always create irubyobject but pron want to use rubyarray concat here fixme as a result this be not efficient since pron create and then later unwrap an array,0
4838, sss fixme what be the difference between classvarasgnnode classvardeclnode,0
4839, fixme set up a callconfiguration for this,0
4840, todo read write from frame todo information on scope todo visibility,0
4841, fixme this be almost entirely duplicate from main java,0
4842, pron may need to perform a dst correction,0
4843, fixme how much more obtuse can this be heredoc already parse this and save string do not parse just return,0
4844, this need to be split since conditional calling inherit do not fit standard ruby semantic,0
4845, xxx again screwy evaling under previous frame s scope,0
4846, sss fixme maybe this be not really a concern after all nest level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scope in the current file this be not to be confuse with semantic nesting of scope across file consider this code in a file f class m1 m2 m3 c end so c be at lexical nesting level of 1 the file script be at 0 in the file f semantically pron be at level 3 m1 m2 m3 be at 0 1 2 this be primarily use to ensure that variable name do not clash i e definition of v 1 in a closure should not override the use of v 1 from the parent scope private int lexicalnestinglevel,0
4847, actual type do not exactly match method return type re get converter fixme when the only autoconversion be primitive this will not be need,0
4848, fixme pron should probably still be dyncalle write here,0
4849, fixme finalizer should be duppe here,0
4850, do not bother to check if final method pron will not be there not generate can not be,0
4851, todo generalize this type check code into irubyobject helper ,0
4852, fixme need to be rethink,0
4853, ruby constant for string should this be move somewhere else,0
4854, let pron only generate method for those the user may actually intend to override that include any define in the current class and any ancestor that be also javaproxyclasse but none from any other ancestor class method define in mixin will be consider intentionally override except those from kernel java and javaproxymethods as well as enumerable todo may want to exclude other common mixin,0
4855, fixme pron do not like the null check here,0
4856, invoke callmethodmisse method directly todo this could be further optimize since some dsl hit method miss pretty hard ,0
4857, todo this be really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone require be something pron should try to make loadpath a special array object ,0
4858, fixme why be this use a fullfunctioncallbackmethod before that do callsuper,0
4859, if body be a rescue node inspect pron piece separately to avoid pron disable all optz todo this be gross ,0
4860, fixme this do not have exact same semantic as rubyarray join but pron probably could be consolidate perhaps as join arg sep dochomp ,0
4861, lame generic issue make segment class static and manually insert cache reference to work around various problem generically reference method var across class ,0
4862, fixme this determine module be in a strange location and should somehow be in block,0
4863, todo pron think this end up propagate from normal java exception sys fail openfile getpath,0
4864, this seem unlikely to happen unless pron be a totally bogus fileno so do pron even need to bother try to create one,0
4865, todo turn off the negative will return 0 0 in lax mode,0
4866, todo list sublist from to clear be suppose to clear the sublist from the list how can pron support this operation,0
4867, see note below re 2 field kludge,0
4868, pron be not set the provider or anything but pron seem that bouncycastle do some internal thing in pron provider s constructor which require pron to be execute in a secure context ideally this hack should be remove see jruby 3919 and this bc bug http www bouncycastle org jira browse bja 227,1
4869, this be a rather ugly hack but similar to mri see hash c ruby setenv and similar in mri pron search all key for a case insensitive match and use that,0
4870, todo wrong get interface from class,0
4871, todo make callcoerced work in block context then fix downto step and upto ,0
4872, fixme the code below be a copy of rubyio put and pron should avoid copy paste ,0
4873, install invokedynamic bootstrapper todo need to abstract this setup behind another compiler interface,0
4874, fixme inefficient construct a bignum just for dump,0
4875, todo ruby do not seem to care about invalid numeric mode value pron be not sure if ruby overflow here also ,0
4876, fixme obvious issue that not all platform can display all attribute ugly hack use generic posix library make push inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful ,0
4877, rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here unlikely ,0
4878, fixme this really ought to be in clinit but pron do not matter much,0
4879, use iochannel may not be the most performant way but pron be easy ,0
4880, todo this should entry into error handling somewhere,0
4881, todo make this do specific arity call,0
4882, sss fixme what happen to the add class in this case,0
4883, sss fixme be pron guarantee that pron splat do not head to multiple assignment node i e a b,0
4884, todo catch exception if constant be already set by other thread,0
4885, todo implement tty and isatty pron have no real capability to determine this from java but if pron could set tty status then pron could invoke jruby differently to allow stdin to return true on this this would allow thing like cgi rb to work properly ,0
4886, fixme pron should be get this from the runtime rather than assume none return runtime getencodingservice getencode runtime getdefaultexternalencoding,0
4887, end hack,0
4888, todo this be not an exact port of mri s pipe behavior so revisit,0
4889, todo protect method this be go to require a rework of some of the mechanism ,0
4890, fixme what should this really be assert x instanceof rubycomplex,0
4891, fixme this be not right for within ensure rescue code,0
4892, sss fixme token can be final for a method imply that the token be only for this particular implementation of the method but if the mehod be modify pron create a new method object which in turn get a new token what make sense intuitively pron seem the first one but let pron see current code version token for this method can change during execution as method get redefine,0
4893, todo pron would be nice to throw a well error for this,0
4894, set up a field for the cacheentry todo make this an array so pron be not as much class metadata similar to abstractscript stuff,0
4895, todo newtypeerror do not offer enough for ruby error string ,0
4896, sss fixme pron add this in be this correct,0
4897, upper case package name todo top level upper case package be support in the previous ruby base implementation so leave as be see note at getproxyorpackageunderpackage re future approach below the top level ,0
4898, todo wire into new exception handling mechanism,0
4899, todo this be also define in the metaclass too consolidate somewhere ,0
4900, fixme constdecl could be two seperate class or do differently since constnode and name never exist at the same time ,0
4901, todo number format here mri use 10 g 1 4 api be a must,0
4902, todo need to get this back into the method signature now be too late ,0
4903, super call from proxy must use reflect method fixme possible to make handle do the superclass call,0
4904, todo well error handling,0
4905, sss fixme should this be operand or compoundstring can pron happen that symbol be build out of other than compound string or can pron happen during optimization that this become a generic operand,0
4906, fixme pron should really not be create the dynamic scope for the root of the ast before parse this make pron end up need to readjust this dynamic scope come out of parse and for local static scope pron will always happen because of and fixme because pron end up adjust this after the fact pron can not use any of the specific size scope ,0
4907, todo not sure that pron should skip call join altogether thread join have some implication for java memory model etc ,0
4908, hack to get right style for input,0
4909, if variable be add then pron may need to grow the dynamic scope to match the static one fixme make this so pron only need to check this for blockscope null pron can not currently since pron create the dynamicscope for a localstaticscope before parse begin refactoring should make this fixable ,0
4910, sss fixme this method at least in the context of multiple assignment be a little weird pron call regular to ary on the object but if pron encounter a method miss the value be insert into an 1 element array try a b c 1 first then define fixnum to ary method and try pron again ex http gist github com 163551,0
4911, fixme potentially could just use bytelist here,0
4912, ignore job be cancel fixme be this ok,0

5079, kludge pron want some info about the column to be available for validate the user input during cell editing operation ideally pron would get that info inside the resultsetdataset class during the creation of the columndefinition object by use various function in resultsetmetadata such as isnullable idx unfortunately in at least some dbmss e g postgres hsdb the result of those call be not the same and be less accurate than the sqlmetadata getcolumns call use in columnstab to get the column info even more unfortunate be the fact that the set of attribute report on by the two call be not the same with the resultsetmetadata list thing not provide by getcolumn most of the datum provide by the resultsetmetadata call be correct however the nullable not nullable property be not set correctly in at least two dbmss while pron be correct for those dbms in the getcolumn info therefore pron collect the collumn nullability information from getcolumn and pass that info to the resultset to override what pron get from the resultsetmetadata ,0

5091, pron set expect and checksum to 1 here since pron do not have that information for release xml file todo can httpclient be use to get the byte size of release xml so pron can perform this check,0
5092, here pron do not completely understand how these type be to be use in all database and pron have not yet have time to implement support in the dialect for pron so this exclude list will keep these less commonly use type from fail the test also since not all of these type appear in java5 and pron currently support compile the code base with pron pron use the integ value for new type that be introduce in java6 rather than the type constant name ,0

5095, copy from java doc matcher replaceall note that backslashe and dollar sign in the replacement string may cause the result to be different than if pron be be treat as a literal replacement string dollar sign may be treat as reference to capture subsequence as describe above and backslashe be use to escape literal character in the replacement string ,0

5112, check the error stream for a problem this be a bit questionable since pron be possible for process to output something on stderr but continue process but without this some problem be not see e g bad argument type message from the process ,0
5113, ok this be a hack currently when precision scale pron have no way to determine if this be valid for the actual datum the problem come when the source db s precision scale be great or report to be great than the precision scale of the destination db in this case pron maximimize both for the destination cause a definition that allow 0 digit to the left of the decimal trouble be without look at the actual data there be no way to tell if this be valid in some case pron will be ok 0 0000000789 in other pron will not be ok 100 123 so for now make the scale be approx one half of the precision to accomodate the most digit to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that cover the majority of case ,0
